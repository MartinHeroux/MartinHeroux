Hello and that you for visiting my Github page!

My name is Martin Héroux and I am currently based in Sydney, Australia. 

I have been coding for over 15 years and love to learn about computer science and the various concepts and practices that underpin clean code and maintainable software. 


## Scientist

I am a Research Fellow at Neuroscience Research Australia, where I work on a variety of exciting projects ranging from sensory illusions and muscle mechanics to motoneuron physiology, electrical stimulation to restore walking after spinal cord injury and various topics related to open and reproducible science. 

You can find my scientific publications on [ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Martin_Heroux) and [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com.au/citations?user=rW2rVqMAAAAJ&hl=en).

I maintain the [scientificallysound](https://scientificallysound.org/) blog with with my colleague and friend Dr. Joanna Diong. We discuss news and trends related to open and reproducible science and provide tutorials on statistics and coding.

## Python Developer

I am passionate about Python and its community. I have been using it for all of my personal and professional projects for several years now.

I have blogged about [Python](https://scientificallysound.org/category/tutorials/python/) on scientificallysound and was fortunate enough to be I a guest on the [TalkPython](https://talkpython.fm/episodes/show/252/what-scientific-computing-can-learn-from-cs) podcast.

I have published two packages on PyPi related to tools I have created as part of my research:

## Human

I enjoy exchanging ideas with like-minded individuals. Feel free to reach out and start a conversation.
